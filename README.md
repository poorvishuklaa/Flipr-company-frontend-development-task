Overview
This project was created using Vite, a modern, fast, and lightweight build tool. We’ve chosen React as the JavaScript framework and incorporated Tailwind CSS for styling. This setup allows for quick development and easy scaling with the ability to efficiently build modern user interfaces.

Technologies Used
Vite: A fast build tool and development server. It provides lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR), optimized builds, and other modern web development features.
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows us to build reusable UI components and handle state and lifecycle events efficiently.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes, allowing developers to style elements by applying classes directly in the markup.
PostCSS: A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins. PostCSS is used by Tailwind CSS to process stylesheets and add vendor prefixes or perform other optimizations.
Autoprefixer: A PostCSS plugin that automatically adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules, ensuring that styles work across various browsers.
Project Setup
Follow the steps below to set up the project locally:

Step 1: Create the Vite Project
Run the following command to create a new project using Vite. You'll be prompted to select the framework and variant:

bash
Copy code
npm create vite@latest ./ --template
Choose the following options during the setup:

Select a framework: React
Select a variant: JavaScript
Step 2: Install Dependencies
After the project setup is complete, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd <your-project-name>
npm install
This command will install the required dependencies for React and Vite.

Step 3: Set Up Tailwind CSS
Install the required packages for Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, and Autoprefixer as development dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
Initialize the Tailwind configuration files by running:

bash
Copy code
npx tailwindcss init -p
This command creates two configuration files:

tailwind.config.js: Configuration for Tailwind CSS where you can customize your design system.
postcss.config.js: PostCSS configuration, which is needed for processing your CSS.
Next, open the tailwind.config.js file and make sure it includes the following content to specify which files Tailwind should scan for classes:

javascript
Copy code
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
In your src folder, locate the index.css file and replace its contents with the following:

css
Copy code
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
This will ensure that Tailwind's base styles, components, and utility classes are imported into your project.

Step 4: Run the Development Server
Once all dependencies are installed and the Tailwind CSS configuration is set up, you can start the development server to preview your app:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This command starts Vite’s development server and should open the application in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.
